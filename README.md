# Introduction and Interests

I am Shubham, a Game Programming and Development (GP&D) major at SNHU. Games are something we can all relate to. From board and card games to party games and (now) videogames, we all play games. What interests me the most about games is their interactive nature. My first programming project in high school was a text-based quiz game modelled after 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' written in C++. One of the highlights of that project (besides the game logic) was my implementation of its String class, which was functionally similar to std::string (which was not allowed for that project). Although not showcased here, the use of games as a narrative medium also interests me. I think the experience of being in the game world and being able to influence it through interaction makes games a uniquely powerful narrative medium.

My primary interests in the field of game development are game design (including ludic design or the design of gameplay mechanics and narrative design) and game AI. I see the two as inherently related. Designing the gameplay is to developing the AI logic what framing a problem is to solving it. The interesting thing about game AI is that it presents the unique challenge of developing a 'solution' that is both intelligent but balanced for difficulty, because no one would like to play an unbeatable AI for long.

# Education in GP&D

Throughout my time at SNHU, I have worked with a number of programming languages. Not all my projects have been game programs, but I have picked up more modern C++, C#, Python, and also a bit of Java. Additionally, I have gained some familiarity with the Unreal Engine. In my own time, I have focused on learning about data structures and algorithms, besides some advanced features of C# and Python. One of my favourite term projects was implementing the AI logic for a game of Checkers in IT450; although I settled for an AI that favours defensive play, learning about heuristics was an important lesson in how there is not always a single right answer.

On the art and design side, I have used my courses to practice using Photoshop, learnt designing vector art in Illustrator, and also a bit of Adobe Animate. On the 3D side, I have gained some familiarity with 3DS Max, although my project did not allow as much practice with geometric modelling as with spline modelling. I also took a course in web design, although I didn't get the opportunity to use much of what I learned about web design (using HTML5 + CSS3) in my capstone projects.

# Capstone Projects

Although game development incorporates technical and artistic skills in equal measure, as someone with an interest in computers and programming, I tend to lean more towards the coding side. Consequently, of my four capstone projects (prefixed GAM495), three include game programs written in vanilla modern C++, C# in a UWP app, C++ in Unreal 4.2x, and the fourth is a 3D model created in Blender. The four projects are

## [Video Draw Poker](https://github.com/shubham-puri-7742/GAM495-VideoDrawPoker)

A console-based Draw Poker implementation in C++. Highlights include the redraw logic and the evaluation of poker hands using an array of counters.

## [UWP Minesweeper](https://github.com/shubham-puri-7742/GAM495-UWPMinesweeper)

A UWP implementation of the classic game Minesweeper, scripted in C#. Highlights include adjacency detection (including recursively clearing empty tiles) that is the core mechanic of Minesweeper.

## [Battery Collector 2.0](https://github.com/shubham-puri-7742/GAM495-BatteryCollector2)

A 3D game in Unreal Engine, scripted in C++, where the player is tasked with collecting randomly-spawning batteries to recharge his power. Highlights include subclassing C++ classes in Blueprint and the design of the AI opponent.

## [2D-3D Chess Set](https://github.com/shubham-puri-7742/GAM495-2D3DChessSet)

A chess set that combines the appearance of 3D pieces with 2D Unicode symbols, highlighting the magical power of Booleans.

# Skill Self-Assessment

As mentioned earlier, I am more comfortable with code than art, although I have worked with 2D and 3D art besides code in a number of languages.

C++ is my strongest language due to the sheer amount of experience I've had working with it. Python is close for similar reasons. C# follows the two, and I have an intermediate proficiency in Java. I mostly work in the imperative and object-oriented paradigms (choosing between them based on project complexity). I am familiar with unit testing and have used common debugging techniques, including stepping into a program line-by-line and tracking values in the memory as they change.

I have worked mostly with Unreal Engine 4 in my courses. My skill level with various Unreal tools varies. I am most comfortable with scripting tools, followed by the layout and design tools, followed by the material editor and animation tools.

On the art side of things, I am very comfortable working in Photoshop and Illustrator. I am moderately comfortable modelling in 3DS Max and Blender. Most of my experience with either has focused on modelling using splines/bezier curves, and I have worked with models of a moderate complexity. I am familiar with common modifiers, including Boolean subtractions and intersections, as well as modifiers to generate radially and bilaterally symmetric models.

# Career Path

My first choice for a game development career is gameplay design. A close second choice is artificial intelligence programming. However, as neither role is an entry-level position, I consider gameplay programming a good way to start my career in game development. Outside of technical areas, I would also like to experiment with narrative design sometime, which I consider an essential component and intricately tied to the design of the gameplay, because the two combine to deliver an immersive experience in games.

# Further Learning Goals

Besides working to improve on my current skills and staying up-to-date on recent developments (e.g. C++20 features, new tools in UE5), my learning goals - on my own or in further education - would focus on better understanding of the low-level internal workings of programs such as graphics engines, including working with multithreaded programs at a low level, as well as the declarative programming paradigm, which is the mainstay of functional programming.

In the short term, I would like to focus on data structures and algorithms, as well as abstract solutions such as common design patterns in software development, to add to what I have learnt in my courses.

In my own time, I would certainly aim to become more familiar with another major engine, such as Unity or CryEngine, and, in the longer term, get more acquainted with developing for other operating systems such as Linux or macOS (most of my current projects have either used platform-agnostic code or Windows-specific code).
